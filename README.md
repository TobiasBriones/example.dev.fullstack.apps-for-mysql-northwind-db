Example project for a web app performing CRUD operations into the northwind database demo for MySQL
and a desktop client made in JavaFX for processing customer orders.

## Northwind Database

Get the Northwind database demo for MySQL
from [https://github.com/dalers/mywind](https://github.com/dalers/mywind).

Notice that this database is a really simple and poor-designed schema so the system implementation
is quite limited by that constraint.

## Northwind System

This project consists of a PHP back-end serving the CRUD API to work with the given database 
(Northwind), and two clients; one is a web app for the admin to manage the system, and the other is a
desktop app for the employee (cashier) to take the customer orders.
