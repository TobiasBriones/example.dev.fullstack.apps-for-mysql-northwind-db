Example project for a web app performing CRUD operations into the northwind database demo for mysql and a desktop client made in JavaFX for processing customer orders.

## Northwind Database
Get the Northwind database demo for MySQL from [https://github.com/dalers/mywind](https://github.com/dalers/mywind).

Notice that this database is a really simple and poor-designed schema so the system implementation is quite limited by that constraint.

## Northwind System
This project consists of a PHP back-end serving the CRUD API to work with the given database (Northwind), and two clients; one is a web app for the admin to manage the system, and the other is a desktop app for the employee (cashier) to take the customer orders.
